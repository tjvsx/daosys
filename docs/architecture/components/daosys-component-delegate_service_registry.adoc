Delegate Services are published through the ASE's Delegate Service Registry.
When a new Delegate Service is deployed through the Service Proxy Factory, the Delegate Service Registry is updated with information about the new Delegate Service.
This includes mapping the new Delegate Service address to the bitwise XOR of the interfaces the Delegate Service exposes.
This defines the Delegate Service ID that is used to define the Service Proxy configuration used to deploy new Service Proxies.
Including any declared Service dependencies for the new service.
In addition to the custom interface, the Service Registry also implements the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC-1820] Standard as best as possible.
The deviation from ERC-1820 is documented in it's own section.

The foundation for identifying and consuming Services is the interface ID as computed by the Solidity compiler.
This is explained in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165].
The ASE relies on https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165[ERC-165] interface IDs because of the computation from the bytecode.
This eliminates potential conflicts from the arbitrary naming convention proposed in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1820[ERC-1820].

In the context of the Delegate Service Registry, the limitation of not being able to include duplicate Services for an interface ID is intended.
This can forces the inclusion of distinct identifiers is a duplicate is required.
And facilitates reuse of external Delegate Services with internal Services.
Delegate Services should include their own interface that extends an existing on if they tightly couple an external interface with domain specific logic.
And example would be the token standard in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[ERC-20] and how it does not dictate the internal behavior.
This has allowed for a wide variety of token logic that still conforms with the standard.
To handle deploying multiple Services that all expose the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[ERC-20] interface, new Services should extend the interface with domain specific interfaces.

A concrete example would be a Basic https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[ERC-20] token compared to a rebasing https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20[ERC-20] token.
A rebasing token would differentiate itself with one or more interface extensions that exposes functions specific to the rebasing implementation.
This also applies to Services that compose existing Services in novel configurations.
They can distinguish themselves from the base Service by defining an interface that composes all the exposed interfaces.
If a new Service links to an external library it only needs to include external library functions as an interface extension if they will be directly mapped in the Service Proxy when configuring the service.

The Service Registry exposes the stored mapping of a Service ID to the Service Address.
While this is also computable as the Service ID is the salt for deploying a new Service, it's included for completeness with the other Service metadata.
The Service Registry also exposes the mapping of Services that serve a distinct interface.
This results in a rather large array of addresses that is not feasible to read on-chain.
This is provided for off-chain resources to provide a simple reference of all available Services for an interface ID.
Further, an enumeration of the functions declared in an interface is presented to facilitate off-chain resources searching the Service Registry.
