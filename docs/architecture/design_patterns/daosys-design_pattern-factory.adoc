The Factory design pattern utilizes the CREATE and CREATE2 OPCODES of the EVM to deploy new smart contracts.
A typical factory will deploy initialize a single type of smart-contract.
An example of this can be seen in any AMM, such as Balancer and Uniswap.
The CREATE2 OPCODE allows for salting the smart-contract address calculation to make it computable.
Factories will typically use this functionality to deploy contracts to addresses that can be precomputed.
This allows for smart-contract address discovery without having to read from storage.

A unutilized second order feature is available by using CREATE2 to deploy contracts from a factory.
Because addresses can be precomputed, they can also be verified through recomputation.
When deploying a smart-contract from another smart-contract, a hash of the factory's bytecode is used to calculate the address of the new smart-contract.
This bytecode is available on-chain from the smart-contract address, and is therefore immutable.
This means that when a smart-contract is deployed, it can self-report it's factory and salt used when it was deployed.
A smart-contract can verify the pedigree of a contract by recalculating the contract address.
This means that an implicit trust can be bootstrapped from an address.

This pedigree verification capability is used by the ASE to allow for an implicit access control list (ACL).
The implicit ACL can be used by modules available from the ASE to allow integration with new proxies deployed by the factory.
Proxies can allow interaction with tokens and pools that have not been deployed yet.
