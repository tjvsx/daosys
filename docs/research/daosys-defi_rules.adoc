== Rule 0 - I need no sanction for my being

Governance is cancer.
Democracy is tyranny.
Multi-sig is theft.

== Rule 1 - The chain is the only source of truth

On-chain data is the only acceptable source of truth during a transaction.
If a price oracle is needed, that price oracle must be on-chain, and must calculate the price using on-chain data.

== Rule 2 - Thou shalt have no price before the TWAP

Always use the time weighted average price to protect against market manipulation during a transaction.

== Rules 3 - Only trust known addresses

Only accept deposits and process tokens of known addresses.
Use either an explicit ACL of allowed tokens, or verify the token address pedigree.

== Rule 4 - Only index cash in hand

When processing deposits take the money first, and only count the amount received.

== Rule 5 - One in the hand is worth two in the bush; unless that bush is deterministic

Being deterministically owed money is worth more then having money now.

== Rule 6 - AMM all the things

If you can't figure out how to make your protocol permissionless and autonomous, you don't have a defi protocol.
Go back to the drawing board.

== Rule 7 - Treasury money is not yours

Always respect the root ownership.
Users must have full control of their assets.
Buy their assets instead of accept deposits.

== Rule 8 - Leave only interest, take only profit

Interact with markets in a manner that maintains long term health.
Do not extract the most amount of capital.
Compound into liquidity.
